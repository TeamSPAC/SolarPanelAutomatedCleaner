									<h2>Team Lead: Dylan Nolan</h2>
									<p1>Electrical Engineer<br />
									Hello and thank you for visiting our webpage. Allow me to tell you a little about myself. In 2015, I received
									my associates in arts from Meridian Community College before moving to Mississippi State University to continue
									my studies in electrical engineering. I am now a senior studying at Mississippi State University, and my background
									is in industrial automation and controls. In the summer of 2016, I worked at CertainTeed in Meridian, MS, and the 
									following summer of 2017, I worked at Steel Dynamics Inc. in Columbus, MS. My personal philosophy in life is that 
									it’s the little things that make the biggest difference. Andy Andrews, an author from Orange Beach, Alabama, writes,
									“…when small moves are repeated consistently over time, you’ll one day look up and realize you’ve traveled all the way 
									from where you were to exactly where you always dreamed you’d be.”1<br /> 
									1 Andrews, A. (2017). The little things: why you really should sweat the small stuff. Nashville: W Publishing Group.<br /><br /></p1>

									<h2>Aaron Hale</h2>
									<p1>Electrical Engineer<br />
									I received my associate degree from Holmes Community College before transferring to Mississippi State University.
									I've always enjoyed working with my hands, whether that be building something with wood, or working with electronics.
									As an Electrical Engineering Co-op, I worked for Weyerhauser the Summer of 2016 and International Paper for the entire 2017 year.
									I loved the process control aspect more than anything because I got to work hands on with all different kinds of devices.
									I gained experience with PLCs, Delta-V, motors, drives, sensors, and more. I believe these attributes will
									help me in this design course and with what I aspire to be in the future.<br /><br /></p1>

									<h2>Daniel Coats</h2>
									<p1>Electrical Engineer<br />
									Hi, I’m Daniel and I transferred to Mississippi State after I received my Associate of Art from Jones Junior College. 
									From an early age, I have enjoyed problem solving and helping others. These two factors led me to majoring in Electrical Engineering, 
									where I can use my education to aid the general public. Making life easier is a key factor in this design, and I plan to apply the 
									knowledge I gain from this process in any future employment.  I also enjoy traveling to new places with my wife and participating in 
									activities around our church and community. Currently I am a member of the Mississippi Army National Guard and, upon the completion of 
									my degree, look forward to commissioning as a second lieutenant.

									<h2>Scott Watson</h2>
									<p1>Electrical Engineer<br />
									I loved math and science in high school, and decided that I wanted a career in which I could apply
									those subjects. Studying electrical engineering at MSU has also allowed me to pursue my interest 
									in design and problem solving. I believe this project will be an incredible learning experience that 
									will help create a foundation for my future in EE.<br /><br /></p1>
